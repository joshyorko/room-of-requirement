# NOTES:
# - To enable: change `if: false` to a condition such as `env.NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED == 'true'` and set the secret
# - For Teams: you can replace the step with a simple curl to a Teams incoming webhook or use a maintained action
# - Keep secrets and webhook URLs in repository or org secrets, and document who can rotate them
